<p class="pt-12 border-b pb-12 border-neutral-300 dark:border-neutral-600">Founded in 1916, LEGO built its brand on the motto “Only the best is good enough” (Starvish, 2013). Its name—Danish for “Play Well”—reflects a deep commitment to quality and play. Yet by 1998, the company was near bankruptcy. This case explores how LEGO reinvented itself to survive.</p>

Interestingly, the Lego System, when it was introduced, was just basic boxes of bricks, sold with no instructions. Leadership wanted to react to customer ambiguity (What should I do with a system?): <span class="text-red-400 italic">Sell sets with a theme!</span>

</v-click>

<v-click>

Internally, Lego employees were steadfast in their belief that "the system plus imagination" was strong enough and didn't need instructions or themes, but in 1970, the first "Legoland" themed set with instructions was released (LEGOLAND® range, n.d.).

Between 1998 and 2004, in response to video games, Lego got the advice (and followed it) that the "classic brick is dead" and Lego should expand into media, theme parks, and fashion (Davis, 2017). This expansion stretched the brand beyond its identity (Robertson & Breen, 2013).

Over-diversification strained internal systems and confused customers.

<v-click>

By 2003, <span class="text-red-400 italic">LEGO was on the brink of financial collapse</span>: sales had fallen by 30% year-over-year, the company amassed nearly $800 million in debt, and that year it posted an operating loss of $228 million on just over $1 billion in revenue (Robertson & Breen, 2013).

In 2004, under new CEO Jørgen Vig Knudstorp and with a substantial infusion of personal wealth from the last CEO, Lego refocused on its core: the brick system, creative play, and fewer—but better—product lines (Robertson & Breen, 2013).

</v-click>
<v-click>

Licensing hits like Star Wars helped reconnect the Lego system to culture, not just kids (Kotter, 1996). And doubling down on Lego Ideas (a customer voting system for sets), and a new Architecture line specifically targeted for adults, all expanded into new, extremely loyal, customers.

<!--
Step 1: Urgency: The dire financial state of LEGO by 2003-2004, with $800 million in debt, 30% sales decline, and daily losses of $1 million, created an undeniable sense of urgency. Knudstorp gave a "burning platform" address to staff and communicated that change was crucial to survival of the company (Merrill 2022).
Step 2: Guiding Coalition: At the top, he had the support of owner Kjeld Kirk Kristiansen (who invested funds and gave Knudstorp latitude despite him being an “outsider” CEO) (Andersen & Ross, 2016).
